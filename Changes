Revision history for Perl extension MOSES::MOBY.

.85 Fri May 9 7:52:35 2008
	- fixed a bug in one of the test cases.
	
.85 Fri May 9 7:52:35 2008
	- fixed a bug in Parser.pm that created xrefs 
	and called non-existent method isSimpleXref.
	- added namespace checking for inputs. It is
	inserted into impl code that is generated, but
	is commented out.
	- added $VERSION to every module. As a result,
	some of the modules have large increments in
	version numbers with little changes to back up
	the jump. Sorry.
	- added support for 'cgi' category moby services
	- updated the makefile to correctly identify the
	version of IO::Prompt to use so that users dont
	have to downgrade when they accidently install
	the wrong version (i.e. 0.99.4)
	- added a new -R option to the generate-* scripts.
	This option allows you to specify a registry URL
	to use when generating moses scripts.
	

.84 Tue Dec 11 7:52:35 2007
	- updated the default moby url to be the 
	  new ucalgary one because the one hosted 
        at icapture died
	- made the default 'SAX' parser XML::LibXML.
	  This isn't really a SAX parser, but it 
        seems to be the only reliable option

.82 Tue Sept 4 10:21:26 2007
	- updated the documentation to make
        certain things more clear.
      - fixed a bug that caused dos line breaks
        to appear in generated code
      - created a new script that adds/removes
        user defined registries from the file
        system
      - modified MOSES::MOBY::Cache::Registries
        and added 2 subs, one for adding 
        registries and the other for removing
        them

.81  Wed Aug 22 10:21:26 2007

	  pod doc and fixed them
