MOSES-MOBY version .82
======================

OVERVIEW

Perl Moses is a generator of Perl code - but this 
code does not need to be always stored in files, 
it can be generated on-the-fly every time a 
service is called. Also, there are up to four 
things to be generated: objects representing
BioMoby data types, classes establishing bases 
for services, empty (but working) service
implementation modules, and cgi-bin scripts,
the entry points to BioMoby services.
